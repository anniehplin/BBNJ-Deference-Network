BBNJ_def_network.csv contains network data used to generate codes in BBNJ_Deference_Network.Rmd
BBNJ_32IOs_Deference_Description.xlsx contains 32 workbooks corresponding to 32 BBNJ IOs. It includes the original coding of deference scores from IO documents. I take the average of deference scores of each IO pair in the directed-dyad year, forming the variable `Def.score.avg` in BBNJ_32IOs_Deference_Description.xlsx and BBNJ_def_network.csv.
