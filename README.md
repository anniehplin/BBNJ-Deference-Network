`BBNJ_def_network.csv` contains network data used to generate codes in `BBNJ_Deference_Network.Rmd`.

`BBNJ_32IOs_Deference_Description.xlsx` contains 32 workbooks corresponding to 32 BBNJ IOs. It includes the original coding of deference scores from 1,992 pieces of IO documents. I take the average of deference scores of each IO pair in the given directed-dyad year, forming the variable `Def.score.avg` in both `BBNJ_32IOs_Deference_Description.xlsx` and `BBNJ_def_network.csv`.
